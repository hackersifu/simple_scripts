Simple scripts I've made for personal use

webpagescript.py - runs through multiple web pages for the purpose of testing network response through a proxy

hackersifu_decoder.py - a simple decoder for base64 strings

ec2_nasty_ssh.py - A quick script I use to log into an EC2 instance, instead of typing/up arrow for SSH each time. Uses Python3.
